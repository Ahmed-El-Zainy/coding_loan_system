# coding_loan_system

**coding_loan_system** is a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting loan approvals. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, interpretability tools, and a user-friendly demo interface. The project leverages real-world datasets to analyze key factors influencing loan approval decisions, applies advanced feature engineering and statistical tests, and provides interactive tools for both technical and non-technical users to explore model predictions. Ideal for those interested in financial analytics, machine learning interpretability, and practical deployment of predictive models.
